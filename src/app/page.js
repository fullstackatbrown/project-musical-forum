          About the Brown Musical Forum
        </h2>
        <p className="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
          Musical Forum (MF) is an entirely student run group at Brown
          University dedicated to the production of musical theatre by the
          student body. Our mission is to bring exciting, entirely student
          produced musical theatre to the Brown University campus, while
          nurturing budding directors, designers, and actors. We produce one
          full-length musical each semester in T.F. Green Hall‚Äôs PW Downspace,
          in addition to a concert musical or revue during the fall semester,
          and a Mini-Musical Festival each spring. We also organize and produce
          cabaret nights, workshops, and other musical theatre opportunities
          throughout the academic year. Originally called ‚ÄúThe Musical Forum,‚Äù
          MF was founded in 1987. Musical Forum‚Äôs first production, You‚Äôre a
          Good Man, Charlie Brown, was mounted in March of that year. Since
          then, we have produced over 50 full-length musicals and supported
          hundreds of student theatre artists. For over 30 years, Musical Forum
          has allowed professional quality musical theatre produced by students
          for students to thrive on Brown‚Äôs campus. Notable alumni include Tony
          Award winner John Lloyd Young, New York Musical Theatre Festival
          executive producer Isaac Hurwitz, playwright Stephen Karam, Broadway
          actor Jed Resnick, and Charlie Alterman, musical director of the
          Pulitzer Prize-winning Next to Normal.
