                You can expect to work with a budget of approximately $1,000.

                If you are proposing a licensed show, theater rental and rights
                are taken care of by Musical Forum and do not come out of your
                budget. Let us know how you plan on allocating the budget to
                your different expenses. We understand that you may not be able
                to give us a complete and accurate budget, but we want you to
                give us a general estimation of the budget breakdown. Typical
                expenses include set, costumes, and props.

              <li>
                The show process is typically 5–7 weeks. Write a short breakdown
                of each week of rehearsal. What will you cover? When will you
                have runs of your show?
              </li>
              <li>
                The current show slot is unknown, but typically in early
                November (we are currently in the process of reaching out to
                Granoff). While we are open to finding alternative spaces and
                dates that might suit your show better, when drafting your
                timeline be prepared for your show to open as early as the
                weekend of November 1st.

          Is there material in this project that would require additional
          considerations (e.g. content, music, etc)? Are there sensitive themes
          and if so, how do you envision engaging with them throughout the
          process? (1-2 paragraphs)

          We encourage– but it is not required– you to bring a visual component
          to the interview to show us you have been thinking about the “look” of
          your show. It can be as simple as a pinterest board!
