                  As a producer, you might be met with unexpected problems. Talk
                  about a time when a plan of yours went wrong, and how you

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What Show are you proposing? Sweeney Todd</li>
            <li>
              Are there any sensitive themes, topics, and/or scenes in this show
              you think are worth discussing (or potential content warnings)? If
              so, how would you address these themes? Sweeney Todd deals with
              themes of violence that are upsetting to many, and it’s essential
              that content warnings are put in place. I think the show is still
              worth performing because its violence is not gratuitous.
            </li>
            <li>
              How many weeks do you envision this rehearsal process will be? I
              want to make this show accessible to as much of the Brown
              community as possible, especially those with on-campus jobs, so my
              plan is to rehearse 5 nights a week instead of 6. I’m confident
              that we can accomplish what we need to in the allotted 6-week
              period. We will learn music and do character work first, then add
              blocking and move into tech.
            </li>
            <li>
              Are there any other pieces of your vision for this show that might
              require extensive logistical planning or sufficient budgeting to
              support? My vision for the show is fairly minimalist, with the
              cast dressed in black and the set composed of a series of black
              cubes and music stands that can be rearranged at the top of each
              scene. So the only logistical concerns I have are the fact that
              the music is pretty difficult and that it may be difficult to cast
              Johanna, who needs to be a legit soprano.
            </li>
            <li>
              What is your idea for the set? As mentioned above, the set will be
              mostly made up of black cubes and music stands that can be
              rearranged to form a barber's chair, a pie shop, etc. I hope to
              denote individual scenes with compartmentalized lighting and keep
              all non-block set pieces on wheels so scene changes can be
              efficient and doable.

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What show are you proposing? Hairspray</li>
            <li>
              Are there any sensitive themes, topics, and/or scenes in this show
              you think are worth discussing (or potential content warnings)? If
              so, how would you address these themes? Hairspray deals with
              themes of racism, classism, fatphobia, police brutality, and the
              white savior complex. It’s important to acknowledge that these
              issues are present before rehearsals begin. I will hold info
              sessions before auditions, dramaturgy sessions once a week at
              rehearsal, and do frequent individual check-ins to create a safe
              space. I hope to hold a talk-back with relevant professionals in
              the field of American Studies to contextualize the show.
            </li>
            <li>
              How many weeks do you envision this rehearsal process will
              be? Hairspray is a dance-intensive show, and I am excited to also
              choreograph it! That said, we will need an extended rehearsal
              process to accommodate the less experienced dancers in the cast.
              I’m proposing a 9-week rehearsal process, and I will be asking for
              a considerable commitment from every ensemble member.
            </li>

              Are there any other pieces of your vision for this show that might
              require extensive logistical planning or sufficient budgeting to
              support? Most productions of Hairspray include a large can of
              hairspray which Tracy pops out of at the end of the show. This
              would require a significant chunk of the budget, so I hope to
              accomplish the same thing with just a few of the flats and set
              pieces we already have. We will devote a more significant portion
              of the budget to other parts of the set and ‘60s-era costumes.
            </li>
            <li>
              What is your idea for the set? Hairspray requires a fairly
              involved set with several locations, so I will be incorporating
              rolling flats for each new scene, each with their own distinctive
              color scheme. I plan to recruit RISD students to help me with the
              color palette of this production.
